## Current Status and Future Work

The system is functional and can detect plant stress in real-time using iPhone Continuity Camera. However, further testing and calibration is needed as the confidence values are currently showing some variance from expected results. The model accuracy of 51.48% on 27 classes is good for a multi-class problem, but additional training data and fine-tuning could improve performance.

### Planned Improvements
1. Improve accuracy with more training data
2. Add GPS integration for field mapping
3. Deploy to mobile as iOS app
4. Add more plant types and diseases
5. Implement severity assessment for detected issues
6. Add treatment recommendations based on detected diseases
